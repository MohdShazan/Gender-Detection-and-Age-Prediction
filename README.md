# Gender Detection and Age Prediction

This project uses deep learning and OpenCV to detect the gender and predict the age of people in images or video streams. The model is based on pre-trained neural networks and is designed to run in real-time on a webcam feed or image.

## Features
- Detects gender (Male/Female) using a pre-trained model.
- Predicts the age of the person using a pre-trained age prediction model.
- Real-time gender and age prediction using a webcam or video feed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Pre-trained models for gender and age detection (included in the repository).

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gender-age-prediction.git

  
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
Download the required pre-trained models:

Age Model: age_net.caffemodel (located in the repository)
Gender Model: gender_net.caffemodel (located in the repository)
Run the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to use the gender and age prediction system.
